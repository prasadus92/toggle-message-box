Toggle Message Box
==================

A toggle sidebar for submitting messages or comments online. Typically needed by all websites. Its very annoying and waste to create a separate page for "Leave a Message". This toggle bar is easy to use and has an improved GUI.

How to use:

Its easy and simple. 

1. Just copy the code within body tag of index.html to your HTML page just before end of body tag.

2. Copy all JavaScript and CSS files to your respective directories.

3. You are done!! Create a PHP file for form submission.
